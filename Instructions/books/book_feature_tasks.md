## Backend API & Controller Logic
- Implement endpoints for adding new books
- Implement endpoints for editing book details
- Implement endpoints for deleting books (with validation for active borrows)
- Implement endpoints for searching/filtering books

- Display detailed book information and available copies
- Add UI for adding/managing book copies
- Show copy status and borrowing history in the book details view

## Validation & Business Rules
- Enforce unique ISBN and copy IDs
- Prevent deletion of books with active borrows

## Integration
- Connect EJS frontend to backend API for all book actions
- Handle success/error messages and page updates after actions

## Testing
- Write tests for backend endpoints and business logic
- Test frontend interactions and edge cases
